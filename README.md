# ICMyC_Classification

## Created an Attention-based NLP response categorization model for 42 classes. 

* Sampled and cleaned 56k User Responses.
* Creation and examining of a custom embedding space.
* Performed experiments to handle imbalanced class ratio. 
* Developed and analysed multiple bi-directional LSTM models followed by a small attention network to get better sentence level embeddings.
* Performed necessary regularizations and obtained top 3 accuracy - resulting in significant model result improvements.
